Try to memorize the layout to plan your strategy before bubbles slide down from the top. Use your ring shooter and precision color-matched laser targeting line to aim projectiles at clusters of three or more matching bubbles. Swap between your two available projectiles by selecting the ring when needed. Utilize special bubbles like dynamite to create explosive chain reactions, and build consecutive hits to charge powerful boosters such as bombs and rainbow bubbles. Complete the specific mission objectives for each level to earn stars, coins, and unlock new challenges."
